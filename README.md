# COMN Assignments

This repository contains the description and resource of COMN assignments.
You can do all the assignments in a Linux VM created based on the procedure in
[vm/README.md](./vm/README.md). You can use another environment at your own
risk; no support will be given for that.

Assignments divide into three categories: [traffic_analysis](./traffic_analysis)
and others that will appear in due course.
Each category contains README.md that describes your task, marking criteria and
hints, and introduction.md that contains prerequisite knowledge.
